# SLIP39 Share Generation Hints

## A 2-of-3 setup can be distributed as follows:
- Give one share to a close relative, ask him/her to keep it in a safe.
- Give another share to another relative, ask him/her to keep it in a safe.
- Keep the final share yourself in a highly secure location, such as a bank's safe deposit box.

Note: This method is vulnerable to collusion between the two relatives.

## A 3-of-4 setup improves security:
- Give one share to a close relative.
- Give another share to another relative,
- Keep the two remaining shares yourself, storing them at separate secure locations (e.g., two different bank vaults).

Advantage: This configuration protects against both collusion and the infamous "$5 wrench attack."

## For even greater security, a 4-of-6 setup can be used:
- Give one share to a close relative.
- Give another share to another relative.
- Give the third share to a trusted friend for safekeeping.
- Keep the three remaining shares yourself, stored at separate secure locations.

Advantage: This provides robust protection against both collusion and physical coercion.

However, ultimately all pieces of the secret can be "hunted down" by a resolute attacker.
