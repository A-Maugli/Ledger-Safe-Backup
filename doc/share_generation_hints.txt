# SLIP39 Share Generation Hints

A 2-of-3 share setup can be distributed as follows:
- give one share to a close relative, ask him/her to keep it in a safe
- give another share to another relative, ask him/her to keep it in a safe
- keep the final share yourself in a highly secure location, such as a bank's safe deposit box.
Note: This method is vulnerable to collusion between the two relatives.

A 3-of-4 share setup improves security:
- give one share to a close relative,
- give another share to another relative,
- keep the two remaining shares yourself, storing them at separate secure locations (e.g., two different bank vaults).
Advantage: This configuration protects against both collusion and the infamous "$5 wrench attack."

For even greater security, a 4-of-6 share setup can be used:
- give one share to a close relative,
- give another share to another relative,
- give the third share to a trusted friend for safekeeping
- keep the three remaining shares yourself, stored at separate secure locations.
Advantage: This provides robust protection against both collusion and physical coercion.

But at the end of the day, all pieces of the secret can be "hunted down".
For reference, see the infamous horcuxes of Woldemort in the Harry Potter series of books.
